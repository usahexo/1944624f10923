        <h1 id="Halloweenies-Game-Targets-Millennials"><a href="#Halloweenies-Game-Targets-Millennials" class="headerlink" title="Halloweenies Game Targets Millennials"></a>Halloweenies Game Targets Millennials</h1><p>Halloweenies, the new mobile game from app developer AD1 Games, is specifically designed to appeal to millennials, according to CEO of AD1 Games Amir Goldstein. “We wanted to create a fun, engaging game that would capture the attention of millennials and get them excited about Halloween,” said Goldstein. “Halloweenies is perfect for anyone who loves excitement and color in their lives.”</p>
<p>The object of Halloweenies is to help the characters Moana, Max, and Mia collect as many pieces of candy as possible before time runs out. The game is played by swiping left or right on the screen to change lanes and avoid obstacles. There are different levels with different challenges and obstacles, as well as bonus rounds where players can collect extra points and items.</p>
<p>One of the things that makes Halloweenies unique is its colorful graphics and upbeat music. Goldstein said that the team put a lot of thought into designing a game that would be visually appealing and fun to play. “We wanted players to feel like they’re in a world of their own where anything is possible,” he said. “And we think we’ve achieved that with Halloweenies.”</p>
<p>Since its release a few weeks ago, Halloweenies has quickly become one of the most popular games on the App Store. Goldstein attributes this success to the game’s appeal to millennials. “Halloweenies is all about having fun and enjoying life,” he said. “And millennials are all about that.”</p>
<h1 id="Halloweenies-Game-Targets-Women"><a href="#Halloweenies-Game-Targets-Women" class="headerlink" title="Halloweenies Game Targets Women"></a>Halloweenies Game Targets Women</h1><p>Halloweenies, the new mobile game from independent developer Ryan Henson Creighton, is a shamelessly sexist app that objectifies women and encourages players to harass them.</p>
<p>Halloweenies is a “ haunted house puzzle game” in which players navigate a series of spooky rooms in order to rescue five female victims. The women are scantily clad and sexualized, and their movements are extremely limited. In one room, for example, the player must guide a woman through a shower obscured by steam – her body is largely exposed and it’s clear that her only purpose is to titillate the player.</p>
<p>ickeyreviews.com Halloweenies review</p>
<p>What could be worse than an entire game built around rescuing scantily clad women from danger? How about the fact that the women in question can barely move, and are essentially just there for your viewing pleasure? If you’re looking for a misogynistic gaming experience this Halloween, look no further than Halloweenies.</p>
<h1 id="Halloweenies-Game-Targets-Men"><a href="#Halloweenies-Game-Targets-Men" class="headerlink" title="Halloweenies Game Targets Men"></a>Halloweenies Game Targets Men</h1><p>In the spirit of Halloween, a new video game has arrived that is specifically designed to terrify men. Called “Halloweenies,” the game takes place in a haunted house and features spooky ghosts, zombies and other monsters.</p>
<p>Although it may seem like a silly novelty game, Halloweenies is actually quite challenging. Players must navigate through the haunted house while avoiding the various creatures that are out to get them. The aim of the game is to make it to the end without being caught by any of the monsters.</p>
<p>Halloweenies is available for free on Google Play and the App Store. So if you’re looking for a scare this Halloween, be sure to check it out!</p>
<h1 id="Halloweenies-Game-Targets-Seniors"><a href="#Halloweenies-Game-Targets-Seniors" class="headerlink" title="Halloweenies Game Targets Seniors"></a>Halloweenies Game Targets Seniors</h1><p>“Halloweenies,” the new game from Hasbro and Lionsgate, is being marketed as a “fun and fiendish game for seniors.”</p>
<p>The object of the game is to move your pieces around the board, collecting as many candy pieces as possible. But watch out for the ghosts! If they touch your piece, you lose a turn. The first player to collect all six of their candy pieces wins the game.</p>
<p>The game is recommended for ages 8 and up, but can be played by younger children with adult supervision. It is a great game for family get-togethers or parties with friends.</p>
<p>Halloweenies is available now at major retailers nationwide.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Rewards-Programs-Goes-After-Younger-Gamblers"><a href="#Casino-Rewards-Programs-Goes-After-Younger-Gamblers" class="headerlink" title="Casino Rewards Programs Goes After Younger Gamblers"></a>Casino Rewards Programs Goes After Younger Gamblers</h1><p>Casinos are always looking for new ways to bring in customers and keep them coming back. One way is through rewards programs. These programs offer perks and benefits to customers who visit the casino often. Some of these programs are aimed at older gamblers, but casinos are now starting to focus on rewards programs that are aimed at younger gamblers.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons why casinos are focusing on younger gamblers. The first reason is that millennials make up a large percentage of the population. In fact, they make up more than one-third of the population in the United States. casinos want to capture as much of this market as possible. Another reason is that millennials are known to be fickle consumers. They’re not loyal to brands like older generations tend to be. If casinos can get millennials started with their rewards program, they’re likely to keep coming back for more.</p>
<p>There are a few things that casinos are doing to attract younger gamblers. For starters, they’re offering better rewards. These rewards usually include free meals, free hotel stays, and free play credits. Casino operators are also getting creative with their marketing efforts. They’re using social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat to target younger gamers.</p>
<p>Casinos aren’t just targeting millennials with their rewards programs. They’re also targeting Gen Xers and baby boomers. However, it’s clear that casinos see the potential in attracting younger gamers and they’re doing everything they can to make sure that these gamers sign up for their rewards program.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Frank-Rosenthal’s-Pharaoh-Casino-Was-a-Major-Hustle"><a href="#Frank-Rosenthal’s-Pharaoh-Casino-Was-a-Major-Hustle" class="headerlink" title="Frank Rosenthal’s Pharaoh Casino Was a Major Hustle"></a>Frank Rosenthal’s Pharaoh Casino Was a Major Hustle</h1><p>Casinos are known for their glamorous displays of wealth, but one casino in particular was a major hustle. The Pharaoh Casino, run by Frank Rosenthal, was infamous for its cheating and illegal activity.</p>
<p>Rosenthal was a professional gambler who got his start in the business by rigging games. He soon became known as one of the most skilled cheaters in the country. In the early 1970s, he partnered with Mafia boss Anthony “The Ant” Spilotro to open the Pharaoh Casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The casino was an instant success, thanks in part to Rosenthal’s skilful cheating techniques. He was experts at fixing games and bribing casino employees to help him cheat. He also developed new methods of cheating, such as using hidden cameras to track the cards being dealt.</p>
<p>The Pharaoh Casino was a major money-making venture for the Mafia. In addition to Fixed games, the casino also offered illegal bookmaking and prostitution services. It was a favourite spot for gangsters and other shady characters.</p>
<p>But the good times didn’t last long. In 1979, Rosenthal was indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit extortion and interstate transportation of gambling devices. He eventually plead guilty and served time in prison.</p>
<p>After his release from prison, Rosenthal continued to run casinos, but he never regained the level of success he had at the Pharaoh Casino. The casino closed down in 1982, after being raided by federal agents.</p>
<h1 id="Frank-Rosenthal’s-Legacy-The-Pharaoh-Casino"><a href="#Frank-Rosenthal’s-Legacy-The-Pharaoh-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Frank Rosenthal’s Legacy: The Pharaoh Casino"></a>Frank Rosenthal’s Legacy: The Pharaoh Casino</h1><p>Frank Rosenthal was a casino executive and mobster who is most notable for his time as the head of the now defunct Stardust Casino.</p>
<p>Born in Chicago in 1929, Rosenthal began his career in gambling as a bookmaker. He soon caught the attention of the Chicago Outfit and was recruited to help run their casinos. In 1973, he was appointed head of the Stardust Casino, which would become one of the most successful casinos in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>However, Rosenthal’s time at the Stardust was not without controversy. He was often involved in feuds with other casino executives and was even investigated by the FBI for his suspected ties to organized crime. In 1982, he was forced to resign from the Stardust after it was revealed that he had been cheating on his wife with other women.</p>
<p>After leaving the Stardust, Rosenthal moved to Miami and opened a new casino called The Pharaoh. However, his tenure at The Pharaoh was also plagued by controversy and he eventually sold the casino in 1985.</p>
<p>Frank Rosenthal passed away from natural causes in 2008. He is remembered as one of the most influential figures in Las Vegas history and his legacy can still be seen in many of today’s casinos.</p>
<h1 id="What-Happened-to-Pharaoh-Casino"><a href="#What-Happened-to-Pharaoh-Casino" class="headerlink" title="What Happened to Pharaoh Casino?"></a>What Happened to Pharaoh Casino?</h1><p>If you’ve been following the online gambling space at all over the past year or so, you may be wondering what happened to Pharaoh Casino. The site has been conspicuously absent from any major affiliate conference, and their social media channels have been largely inactive since early 2017.</p>
<p>Some players are reporting that they never received their winnings from the site, while others say that their accounts were abruptly closed without warning or explanation.Attempts to reach customer service representatives went unanswered, adding to the speculation about what may have happened to Pharaoh casino.</p>
<p>A quick review of web archives reveals that the site’s design and branding has remained unchanged since late 2016, lending credence to the theory that the casino may have gone out of business. While there is no hard evidence to support this claim, it does seem increasingly likely that Pharaoh Casino is no more.</p>
<p>It’s always unfortunate when an online casino closes its doors without warning, leaving players stranded with unfinished business. If you had funds deposited at Pharaoh Casino, your best bet is unfortunately to file a complaint with your credit card company or bank and hope for a resolution.</p>
<h1 id="The-rise-and-fall-of-Pharaoh-Casino"><a href="#The-rise-and-fall-of-Pharaoh-Casino" class="headerlink" title="The rise and fall of Pharaoh Casino"></a>The rise and fall of Pharaoh Casino</h1><p>Pharaoh Casino was once the most popular online casino in the world. It was so successful that it even managed to rival the world’s biggest online casino, Vegas Casino. Pharaoh Casino had everything: a wide variety of games, generous bonuses, and a flawless customer service.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, Pharaoh Casino’s popularity has dwindled. The casino has been accused of scamming its customers and rigging its games. This has led to a decrease in traffic and, as a result, a decline in profits.</p>
<p>The management of Pharaoh Casino has tried to rectify the situation by making changes to the casino’s policies and procedures, but these changes have failed to revive the casino’s fortunes. In fact, things have only gotten worse for Pharaoh Casino in recent months.</p>
<p>The question now is: will Pharaoh Casino be able to recover from this decline? Or will it eventually go bankrupt? Only time will tell…</p>
<h1 id="The-Frank-Rosenthal-Experience-Pharaoh-Casino"><a href="#The-Frank-Rosenthal-Experience-Pharaoh-Casino" class="headerlink" title="The Frank Rosenthal Experience: Pharaoh Casino"></a>The Frank Rosenthal Experience: Pharaoh Casino</h1><p>The opening of the Pharaoh Casino in downtown Las Vegas in 1976 was a momentous occasion. Back then, Las Vegas was still a relatively small town, and the new casino was one of the biggest and fanciest in town. Many celebrities and high-rollers came to check out the new casino, and among them was Frank Rosenthal.</p>
<p>Rosenthal was no stranger to gambling; he had been working in the casino industry since he was a young man. In fact, he had started his career as a pit boss at the Stardust Casino. But the Pharaoh Casino would be his biggest opportunity yet. He was appointed as the casino’s vice president and given free rein to make it one of the most successful casinos in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>And that he did. The Pharaoh Casino quickly became one of the most popular casinos in town, thanks in part to Rosenthal’s marketing skills. He knew how to attract high rollers and kept the casino packed with tourists all year round.</p>
<p>But Rosenthal’s tenure at the Pharaoh Casino would not be without controversy. He had a reputation for being ruthless with his employees and for being involved in several illegal activities, including money laundering and organized crime. In fact, it was Rosenthal’s association with organized crime that led to his downfall; he was eventually banned from all casinos in Nevada.</p>
<p>Despite his troubles with the law, Rosenthal will always be remembered as one of the pioneers of Las Vegas gaming. The Pharaoh Casino was his crowning achievement, and it is still one of the most popular casinos on The Strip today. Thanks, Frank!</p>

You do not want to wear anything that will restrict your movements or make you feel uncomfortable. There are a few things to keep in mind when picking out what to wear.</p>
<p>The first thing to consider is the climate. If you are visiting a casino in the summer, it is important to wear light clothing that will keep you cool. A dress or skirt and blouse is a good option, as well as shorts and a tank top. In the winter, it is important to dress warmly. A sweater, heavy pants, and boots are all good options.</p>
<p>The next thing to consider is the setting of the casino. If you are going to a fancy casino, it is important to dress up. A dress or skirt and blouse for women, or slacks and a shirt for men, is a good option. If you are going to a more casual casino, such as an Indian casino, you can dress more casually. Jeans and a T-shirt are fine for men, while women can wear skirts or pants and a blouse.</p>
<p>It is also important to consider what type of games you will be playing. If you plan on playing table games such as blackjack or poker, it is important to dress formally so that you look professional. If you plan on playing slot machines or electronic games, however, you can dress more casually.</p>
<p>No matter what type of casino Pocket Games Soft tips player you are dressing like; always remember one golden rule: overdressing is always better than underdressing!</p>
<h1 id="How-to-look-like-a-high-roller-at-the-casino"><a href="#How-to-look-like-a-high-roller-at-the-casino" class="headerlink" title="How to look like a high roller at the casino!"></a>How to look like a high roller at the casino!</h1><p>Looking the part is half the battle when it comes to impressing your friends or other casino-goers. Here are a few tips on how to make the most of your casino experience – and maybe even come home a little richer!</p>
<p><em>Dress the part</em>: It’s important to dress for success when you’re hitting the casino. Ladies, this means wearing something classy and revealing at the same time. Guys, button up that shirt and put on a blazer.</p>
<p><em>Bring your lucky charm</em>: Whether it’s a four-leaf clover or a rabbit’s foot, make sure you have your lucky charm with you when you hit the casino. Who knows, it might just be your ticket to winning big!</p>
<p>*Know when to quit: *It can be easy to get carried away when you’re playing games at the casino, but it’s important to remember when to walk away. If you start feeling like you’ve lost too much money, it might be time to pack up and call it a night.</p>

Here’s how to dress for it!"></a>Got a night out at the casino planned? Here’s how to dress for it!</h1><p>A night out at the casino is always an exciting prospect. It’s a chance to let loose and have some fun! But if you’re not sure what to wear, don’t worry - we’re here to help.</p>
<p>First things first, it’s important to dress comfortably. You’ll be spending a lot of time walking around, so it’s best to avoid anything too tight or restrictive. That doesn’t mean you have to go all out in your pajamas, though!</p>
<p>In general, it’s a good idea to stick to darker colors. They’ll help you blend in with the crowd and won’t stand out too much. However, if you feel like dressing up a bit, there’s nothing wrong with going for something brighter or more eye-catching. Just make sure it still fits in with the casino atmosphere.</p>
<p> As for accessories, keep them minimal. You don’t want anything that will jangle or clatter as you walk, or that will get in the way while you’re playing games. A simple necklace or bracelet should do the trick.</p>
<p>And that’s it! With these tips in mind, you’re ready to take on the casino in style!</p>
<h1 id="Pocket-Games-Soft-–-your-guide-to-dressing-up-for-the-casino"><a href="#Pocket-Games-Soft-–-your-guide-to-dressing-up-for-the-casino" class="headerlink" title="Pocket Games Soft – your guide to dressing up for the casino!"></a>Pocket Games Soft – your guide to dressing up for the casino!</h1><p>The casino offers a great night out for anyone looking for a bit of fun, and with the array of colourful lights and sounds on offer, it’s easy to see why. However, if you want to make the most of your visit, it’s important to dress the part!</p>
<p>Below is our guide to dressing up for the casino – read on to find out everything you need to know.</p>
<p>When it comes to dressing for the casino, there are no hard and fast rules – after all, it’s your night out and you should wear whatever makes you feel comfortable. However, there are a few things to bear in mind if you want to look your best.</p>
<p>For men, we recommend wearing smart trousers and a shirt – a smart jacket is also a good option. If you want to add a bit of colour, why not try wearing a tie or bow tie?</p>
<p>For women, we recommend wearing something dressy – a skirt or smart trousers matched with a blouse or top is perfect. Heels are also recommended, as they help to give you that extra bit of glamour.</p>
<p>It’s also important to remember that when it comes to jewellery, less is more. Diamonds and other expensive gems may be the order of the day at the casino, but if you’re not used to wearing them, they can often end up looking gaudy and out of place. Stick to simple pieces instead, and save the bling for another time.</p>
<p>Finally, don’t forget about your hair and makeup! A slick hairstyle and some subtle makeup will help complete your look – just make sure you don’t go over the top. Less is definitely more when it comes to beauty products at the casino!</p>
