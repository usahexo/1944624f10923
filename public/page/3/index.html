Some of these values may be honesty, integrity, hard work, customer service, or innovation. A company’s core values guide their decisions and help to define who they are as a business.</p>
<p>When a company is looking to hire new employees, they will often ask about the candidate’s core values and how they align with the company’s. This is because the company wants to make sure that their employees share in their same beliefs and will uphold the company’s values.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a job, it is important to know what a company’s core values are.
