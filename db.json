Horn was also one of the first people to promote gambling as a form of entertainment, and he helped to make it into a mainstream activity. Thanks to his efforts, casinos flourished and continue to do so today.\n\n#  What did Tom Horn accomplish during his career in the casino industry?\n\nTom Horn dedicated his life to the casino industry and managed to accomplish a lot during his career.
