#  Las Vegas finally legalizes gambling!

On February 21, 2017, the Nevada State Senate voted 16-5 to approve Assembly Bill 466, which allows for gambling in Las Vegas casinos. This was a long time coming for Sin City, as the legalization of gambling has been on the table since 1931. The bill now heads to the desk of Governor Brian Sandoval, who is expected to sign it into law.

This is good news for both tourists and locals in Las Vegas. Gambling is a major draw for tourists, and now they will be able to legally participate in games like blackjack, craps, and roulette. For locals, this means that casinos can now offer table games and slot machines, which should help create jobs and bring in more tax revenue.

There are some who are opposed to gambling legalization, citing its potential negative effects on society. However, many experts believe that regulated gambling is better than an illegal black market. And with casinos now paying out millions of dollars in winning jackpots, it’s clear that the benefits outweigh any risks.

Las Vegas is looking forward to a bright future with legalized gambling. Thanks to Assembly Bill 466, visitors and residents alike can look forward to enjoying all that Sin City has to offer!
