#  Athletic Bilbao Ready to dominate Virtual Sports

Recent news would suggest that Athletic Bilbao are readying themselves to take over the virtual sports world. This is a bold statement, but if their recent investments are anything to go by, they’re certainly gearing up for something big.

The Basque club has recently announced the impending launch of its own esports team. This will see the launch of an all-new division which will be focused purely on competitive gaming. This comes as no real surprise, given the ever-growing popularity of esports worldwide.

Athletic have long been one of the leading clubs in Spanish football. They’ve been crowned champions on eight occasions, and they’ve also lifted the Copa Del Rey on three separate occasions. They’ve always been a club known for their tenacity and attacking style of play.

Now, it seems that they’re looking to replicate this success in the virtual world. The new esports team is set to compete in some of the biggest tournaments out there, and it will be spearheaded by none other than Aduriz himself.

The 37-year-old striker is widely considered to be one of Athletic’s all-time greats. He’s enjoyed a highly successful career in both La Liga and the Europa League. Now, he looks set to lead his team to glory in the virtual world too.

This move could prove to be a shrewd one from Athletic Bilbao. Esports is growing at an incredibly rapid rate, and it looks like it has no intention of slowing down anytime soon. By launching their own team, Athletic can ensure that they stay at the forefront of this rapidly expanding industry.

They won’t be alone either; many other leading clubs around Europe have already jumped on the esports bandwagon. Real Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia are just a few examples. However, Athletic Bilbao may well be the first club to have a team which is solely dedicated to competitive gaming.

So far, very few details about the new squad have been released. However, we can expect them to compete in games such as FIFA 19 and League of Legends . It will be fascinating to see how they perform against some of the best teams in Europe.

One thing is for sure; with Aduriz at the helm, Athletic Bilbao will be a force to be reckoned with in the virtual world!
