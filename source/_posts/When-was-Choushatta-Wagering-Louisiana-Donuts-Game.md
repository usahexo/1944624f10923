#  Choushatta Wagering Louisiana Donuts Game History

The Choushatta wagering Louisiana donuts game is a centuries old Native American game that is still played today. The game is believed to have originated with the Chitimacha tribe and is now enjoyed by people of all ages throughout the state of Louisiana.

The objective of the game is to doughnut (or toss) a small doughnut-shaped object called a choush into a hole in the ground. The player must then recite an incantation or song that gives them permission to take their turn. There are many variations of this song, but all include the words “choush kapcha” which translated from Choctaw means “take your turn”.

To win the game, the player must doughnut the choush into the hole three times in a row. If they fail to do so, their turn ends and the next player takes their turn. The player who wins the game is typically awarded a prize such as a piece of candy or a small toy.

Although wagering is not required, many players like to make it more interesting by betting money or other items on each round. There are even occasional tournaments where players compete for prizes such as gift cards or cash.

#  Choushatta Wagering Louisiana Donuts Game Rules

Choushatta Wagering Louisiana Donuts Game is a three-dimensional race-style game that can be enjoyed with others or by yourself. This game is played using six dice, and doughnut tokens.

The aim of the game is to be the first player to reach the finish line (or to have the most points at the end of the game). The player with the most points at the end of the game, wins!

To play, each player rolls all six dice. They then set four of them aside, keeping them hidden from their opponents. The aim is to roll as many matching numbers as possible with the two dice they are left with. 

Once both players have rolled their two dice, they compare their results. The player with the highest total score, moves their doughnut token one space along the track in the direction of play (either forwards or backwards). If both players have equal totals, then neither player moves their doughnut token and play passes to the next player.

If one or both players roll doubles on their two dice, they get to re-roll them and add the new total to their original total. Play then continues as normal.

If a player rolls a ‘choushatta’ (6), they get an extra turn and can either move their doughnut token or roll all six dice again. 

The first player to reach the finish line (or has the most points at the end of the game), wins!
