#  What is the object of the game?

The goal of the game is to remove all of the tiles from the board.

# How do you play?

Each player begins by selecting a colour and then taking 12 tiles of that colour. The remaining tiles are placed in the centre of the board. Play then commences with the player to the left of the dealer and proceeds clockwise. On a player’s turn they must take either one or two tiles from either end of the row in front of them, provided that they can complete a legal move. That is, they must be able to place the new tile(s) at either end of the row such that:

- The total number of tiles in both rows is always 13;
- No two tiles in either row are the same; and
- The sum of all tile values on the board is always 108.



If at any time a player cannot make a legal move, they must forfeit their turn. The game ends when one player has removed all of their tiles from the board or when no more moves are possible. The winner is then determined based on who has removed more tiles from the board.

#  What are the bonus features?

When it comes to casino games, bonus features are always an interesting topic. Everyone loves a good bonus and casinos know this, which is why they include them in many of their games. But what are Bonus features?

Simply put, bonus features are extra elements that are added to a game in order to make it more exciting. They can take many different forms, but usually involve some sort of special payout or bonus round that players can access by completing certain tasks or triggering specific events.

Bonus features are popular because they add an extra level of excitement and anticipation to the game. They also provide players with the opportunity to win big payouts, which is always a draw. Additionally, bonus features can help to keep players engaged and entertained for longer periods of time, which is obviously great for casinos.

So what kind of bonus features can you expect to find at your favourite casino? Well, it really depends on the game in question. However, common bonus features include wild symbols, scatter symbols, free spins, bonus rounds and pick’em games. Let’s take a closer look at each one.

Wild symbols are probably the most common type of bonus feature. They appear on the screen randomly and can substitute for any other symbol in order to create winning combinations. This can lead to some big payouts if you hit the right combination!

Scatter symbols are another common type of bonus feature. As their name suggests, scatter symbols act as multipliers when appearing in winning combinations and can often lead to some large payouts. They’re also frequently associated with free spins bonuses, so keep an eye out for them!

Free spins bonuses are exactly what they sound like – bonuses that award players with a set number of free spins on a designated slot machine. These bonuses can be extremely lucrative if you hit the right combination of symbols!

Bonus rounds are another popular type of bonus feature. These generally involve playing a special mini-game within the main game in order to win extra prizes or credits. They can be a lot of fun and often offer some pretty decent payouts too!

Finally, we have pick’em games – mini-games that give players the chance to select from several different objects in order to win prizes or credits. These games can be very exciting and often offer decent rewards too!

#  What are the symbols in the game?

In the game there are a variety of symbols. Some are simple and some are more complex. Understanding these symbols is important to playing the game successfully.

The most basic symbols are the numbers one through nine. These represent the different tiles on the board and how they can be moved. The number one tile can only move to the left, while the nine tile can only move to the right. Other than these numbers, all other symbols have multiple meanings.

The most common symbol is the question mark. This represents any number of things, depending on the context in which it is used. In general, it can mean anything from a hidden bonus tile to a secret rule that needs to be followed. It’s important to pay close attention to this symbol when it appears in order to understand what is happening in the game.

Another common symbol is the exclamation point. This usually indicates that something bad has happened or that a player has made a mistake. For example, if a player moves their piece to a spot where another player already has a piece, they will get an exclamation point telling them that they have lost their turn. It’s important to pay close attention to this symbol so that players don’t make mistakes that could cost them the game.

There are also a variety of other symbols that can appear in the game, such as arrows and loops. These symbols are used for moving pieces around on the board and can be very confusing if players don’t know what they mean. By understanding all of the different symbols in the game, players will be able to play much more effectively.

#  What are the odds of winning?

Slot machines are one of the most popular casino games in the world. But what are the odds of winning? And more importantly, how can you increase your chances of coming out on top?

The odds of winning a slot machine depend on the type of machine you're playing. With traditional 3-reel machines, your odds of winning are about 1 in 9. With video slots, your odds are about 1 in 7. With progressive slots, your odds are even lower - typically around 1 in 50,000 or so.

That doesn't mean that you can't win at slots; it just means that your chances are pretty slim. If you want to improve your odds, there are a few things you can do:

- Choose a slot machine with a lower payout percentage. The higher the payout percentage, the lower your odds of winning.

- Play maximum coins. This increases your chances of winning the jackpot (although it also increases your losses if you don't win).

- Avoid progressives. As we mentioned before, the odds of winning a progressive jackpot are pretty low. Stick to regular slot machines instead.

- Use strategy cards. There are many different types of slot machine strategy cards available online; these cards can help you make informed decisions about which machines to play and how to bet.

By following these tips, you can give yourself a better chance of winning at slots - but remember, there's no guarantees! The best advice we can give is to have fun and don't gamble with money you can't afford to lose.
