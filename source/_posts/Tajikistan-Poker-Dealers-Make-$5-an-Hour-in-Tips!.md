#  Tajikistan Poker Dealers Make $5 an Hour in Tips!

In Tajikistan, many poker dealers only make $5 an hour in tips, leading to a low-paying job.

The average salary for a poker dealer in Tajikistan is about $5 per hour, which is much lower than the average wage for other professions in the country. This is likely due to the fact that there are few tourists in Tajikistan, so dealers rely mainly on tips from locals. As a result, many dealers are forced to take other jobs in order to make a living.

There are several ways for dealers to increase their income. Some dealers work multiple shifts at different casinos in order to maximize their earnings. Others focus on dealing games that offer larger tips, such as blackjack or baccarat. Additionally, many dealers dress up and try to create a fun and friendly atmosphere at the table, which encourages players to tip more generously.

Despite the low pay, poker dealing is still seen as a desirable profession in Tajikistan. Dealers often enjoy interacting with people from all over the world, and they get to play cards for a living. In addition, the job can be lucrative if dealers are able to maximize their tips. Thus, while the pay may not be great, the pros definitely outweigh the cons of this career choice.

#  Tajikistan Poker and Casino Dealers Earn Average of $15 an Hour in Tips!

Casino dealers in Tajikistan can earn a great hourly wage in tips from eager players, averaging $15 per hour. In a country where the average monthly salary is just $240, this can be a life-changing opportunity. 

The lure of quick riches has drawn many people to the casinos in Tajikistan. Some of these gamblers are even regular visitors to the casino, returning time and again to try their luck. This means that the dealers can expect to see the same faces most days, which often leads to better tips. 

However, despite the potential for good earnings, casino dealers in Tajikistan do not always receive good tips. Some visitors may be reluctant to part with their money, or they may simply be bad tippers. On the other hand, there are those who will lavish casino dealers with large tips for providing them with a good game and excellent service. 

In general, though, Tajikistan casino dealers can expect to make a decent wage through gratuities from players. With average tips totaling around $15 per hour, this can be a considerable source of income in a country where wages are relatively low.
