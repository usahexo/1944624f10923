#  Orioles fan favorite, Sodapoppin, displaced by shift to online gambling

Baltimore, MD - The Orioles fan favorite and popular Twitch streamer, Sodapoppin, has been displaced by the team's recent shift to online gambling.

Sodapoppin, whose real name is Jonas Karlsson, had been a fixture at Camden Yards for years, but has not been seen at a game this season. That's because the Orioles have all but abandoned their traditional in-person ticket sales in favor of an online gambling platform that allows fans to bet on individual players' performances.

"It's just not the same without Sodapoppin," lamented longtime fan John Smith. "He always seemed to bring us good luck."

While Orioles management insists that the move to online gambling is necessary in order to stay competitive, many fans are unhappy with the change. "I'd rather watch my team lose than bet on them," said one disgruntled fan.

Whether or not Sodapoppin makes a return to Camden Yards this season remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure - Orioles fans will be missing his antics at the ballpark.

#  Sodapoppin signs with Orioles, makes MLB history

Sodapoppin, one of the most popular streamers on Twitch.tv, has announced he has signed a contract with the Baltimore Orioles, making him the first professional gamer to sign a contract with a major league baseball team.

While the move is largely seen as a publicity stunt by both Sodapoppin and the Orioles, there is no doubt that the level of skill necessary to compete at the highest levels of professional gaming is impressive. And while there have been some minor leaguers who have come from other backgrounds (e.g. players who played football or basketball in college), Sodapoppin represents a new frontier for professional sports.

There are certainly some skeptics who argue that video gaming cannot be considered a "sport" in the same way as football or basketball. But if you take a closer look at some of the top competitive gamers, it's clear that there is tremendous skill involved.

For instance, consider someone like Lee "Faker" Sang-hyeok, considered by many to be the best League of Legends player in the world. Faker has won numerous tournaments and earned millions of dollars in prize money. He was even immortalized in an episode of South Park!

There are also gamers who specialize in other genres such as first-person shooters (eSports) or card games (Hearthstone). The skills required to compete at a high level in any one of these games are formidable, and it's clear that professional gaming is here to stay.

So what does this mean for Sodapoppin and his new teammates on the Orioles? In all likelihood, it will be a learning experience for all involved. The Orioles front office will get to see how well Sodapoppin handles himself under pressure, while Sodapoppin will get an up-close and personal look at what it takes to play at the professional level.

It will be interesting to see if any other MLB teams follows suit and signs their own professional gamers. In an age where viewership for traditional sports is declining, it's possible that eSports could provide a much-needed boost. Only time will tell!

#  Orioles take gamble on Sodapoppin and it pays off!

Sodapoppin hit an impressive .348/.426/.614 with 27 home runs and 107 RBI. He was a key part of the Orioles lineup as they made a run to the playoffs.

Sodapoppinâ€™s success was not limited to the regular season either. He continued his hot streak into the playoffs, hitting .355/.405/.714 with 5 home runs and 15 RBI.
