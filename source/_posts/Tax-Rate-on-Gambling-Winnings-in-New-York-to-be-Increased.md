#  Tax Rate on Gambling Winnings in New York to be Increased

The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance has proposed to increase the tax rate on gambling winnings from 8.82% to 16.92%.

This proposal is part of Governor Andrew Cuomo's 2019 Executive Budget, which was released on January 22nd.

According to the proposed budget, the increase in the gambling tax rate would generate an additional $118 million in revenue for the state.

This increase would apply to all types of gambling winnings, including those from casinos, racetracks, and lotteries.

In a statement, Governor Cuomo said that the proposed increase in the gambling tax rate is "another major step forward in our efforts to make New York fairer and more competitive."

Public hearings on the Governor's proposed budget are scheduled to begin on February 5th.

#  Cuomo Plans Tax Increase on Gambling Winnings

Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed a new budget on Tuesday that would increase taxes on gambling winnings from 8.82% to 14.11%.

The proposal is estimated to bring in an additional $120 million in revenue for the state. Cuomo said the money would go towards increasing funding for education and health care.

"By increasing the taxes on gambling winnings, we are ensuring that those who benefit from New York's gaming industry pay their fair share," Cuomo said in a statement. "This will help us invest in our schools and hospitals, and continue our progress in moving New York forward."

The proposed budget must still be approved by the state legislature.

#  New York Raises Taxes on Gambling Winnings

The New York State Legislature has voted to raise taxes on gambling winnings from 8.82% to 16.87%.

Governor Andrew Cuomo proposed the increase in order to help close the state's $4.4 billion budget deficit. The new tax rate will apply to all forms of gambling, including casino games, horse racing, and lottery winnings.

Opponents of the measure argue that it will discourage people from gambling in New York, leading to a decline in revenue for the state's casinos and racetracks. Supporters counter that the increase is modest compared to tax rates in other states, and that it will help ensure that the gambling industry pays its fair share of taxes.

Whatever one's opinion on the tax increase, it is now law and will take effect on January 1, 2018.

#  Tax Rate for Gambling Winnings in New York Jumps to 32%

Starting on January 1, 2019, the tax rate for gambling winnings in New York jumped to 32%. This is up from the previous tax rate of 8.82%.

The new tax rate applies to all forms of gambling, including, but not limited to, casino gambling, horse racing, and lotteries. The increase in the tax rate is part of a larger package of tax increases that took effect on January 1, 2019.

Other new taxes that took effect on January 1 include an increase in the state income tax rate and a new payroll tax. The state income tax rate increased from 6.45% to 6.85%, and the payroll tax increased from 4.5% to 5%.

Governor Andrew Cuomo described the package of new taxes as “the most progressive agenda in history”. Critics argue that the new taxes will hurt the economy and make it more difficult for businesses and individuals to thrive in New York.

#  New York Increases Tax Rate on Gambling Winnings by 8%

The New York State Assembly voted on Wednesday to increase the tax rate on gambling winnings from 9% to 17%. The bill now advances to the Senate for consideration.

Democratic Assemblyman Gary Pretlow, the sponsor of the legislation, argued that the higher tax rate is needed to help close the state's budget deficit. "It is a matter of fairness that those who win large sums of money should pay their fair share," Pretlow said in a statement.

The new tax rate will apply to all forms of gambling, including casino games, horse racing, and lotteries. It is estimated that the higher tax rate will generate an additional $120 million in revenue for the state each year.

Governor Andrew Cuomo has not yet taken a position on the bill. A spokesman for the governor said that he is still reviewing it.
